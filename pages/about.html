<h3>Orientation of SieLabs</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
    SieLabs is an experimental learning initiative that <br>
    breaks away from traditional education methods. <br>
    Instead of just teaching coding concepts, SieLabs <br>
    focuses on real-world problem-solving through <br> project-based learning.
