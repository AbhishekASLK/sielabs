# 💡 SieLabs – Your startup experiments

Welcome to **Sielabs**, a radically new way to learn coding and software development — **where we don't learn first, we build first**.

## 🚀 Vision

At **Sielabs**, we believe that real learning happens when students are solving problems, not just consuming tutorials. Traditional education begins with theory and ends with projects. We flip this model: **you start with the project**, and **learn the concepts only when you need them**. This isn't a course, this is a **lab**.
